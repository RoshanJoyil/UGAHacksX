# VotingBlock
UGA Hacks X project
=======================================================================================================

Decentralized Poll sharing platform.

Main Advantages of using VotingBlock vs traditional voting platforms like strawpoll.

The smart contract is deployed on a public blockchain (e.g., Sepolia), meaning that anyone can view the contract's code, transactions, and logs through a blockchain explorer like Etherscan.

Events like PollCreated, VoteCast, and PollClosed are emitted, providing a clear history of interactions that anyone can audit.

Poll metadata (e.g., questions and options) is stored on IPFS and pinned using Pinata, ensuring that the data is publicly accessible while avoiding centralized control.

Anyone with a connected wallet (e.g., Coinbase, MetaMask) can interact with the system, making it accessible to all Ethereum users.
